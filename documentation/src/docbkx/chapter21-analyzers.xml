	<chapterinfo>
		<abstract>
			<para>This chapter deals with one of the most important concepts in
				DataCleaner: Analyzers. Analyzers are the endpoints of any analysis
				job, meaning that a job requires at least on analyzer.
			</para>
			<para>An analyzer consumes a (set of) column(s) and generates an
				analysis result based on the values in the consumed columns.
			</para>
			<para>Here is an example of a configuration panel pertaining to an
				analyzer:

			<para>In the panel there will always be one or more selections of
				columns. The configuration panel may also contain additional
				properties for configuration.

		<title>Completeness analyzer</title>
		<para>The completeness analyzer provides a really simple way to check
			that all required fields in your records have been filled. Think of
			it like a big "not null" check across multiple fields. In combination
			with the monitoring application, this analyzer makes it easy to track
			which records needs additional information.

						<entry>Whether or not the analyzer should speed up referential

							values are more or less unique, it should definately be turned
							off. But if there is a fair amount of duplication in the foreign
							keys (e.g. orderlines referring to the same products or
							customers), then it makes the lookups faster.

		<tip>
			<para>Duplicate detection does work fine with raw data. But if you have dirty data and the way data is registered has a lot of variance, we suggest you first do your best to standardize the data before finding duplicates.</para>
			<para>Standardization can be by trimming, tokenizing, removing unwanted characters, replace synonyms and things like that. Explore the transformations available in DataCleaner in order to get your data cleansed before trying to deduplicate it.</para>

		<para>In the following sections we will walk through how to use the
			analyzers in the 'Duplicate detection' package.

				The training tool is used by the user of Duplicate detection to
				<emphasis>train</emphasis>
				the Machine Learning engine. With this tool you will be shown a
				number of potential duplicate record pairs, and determine if they
				are duplicate or not.
			</para>

			<para>To start the Training tool, simply add the
				analyzer and select
				the columns that you wish to use for matching.
				Additionally you might
				wish to configure:
			</para>

			<table>
				<title>Training tool properties</title>

						<row>
							<entry>Max records for training</entry>
							<entry>The Training tool will keep a random sample of the dataset
								in memory to provide as training input, and an interactive user
								experience. This number determines how many records will be
								selected for this sample.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Key column</entry>
							<entry>If your dataset has a unique key, we encourage you to

				</tgroup>
			</table>

			<para>In contrast to most other analyzers in DataCleaner which shows
				a result screen after execution, the Training tool opens a new
				dialog when started. The training tool dialog allows users to train
				matching models. The top of the dialog contains a button bar. Below
				the button bar, the training tool shows some tab buttons. By default
				the potential duplicates will be shown. For each potential duplicate
				you can toggle the button on the right side to determine if the pair
				is a duplicate or not:
			</para>

			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="analyzer_reference_training_tool.jpg"

				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>

			<para>You do not need to classify all samples shown. Recommended
				usage is:
			</para>

			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Classify at least 20-30 duplicate pairs or more (more is
						better)
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Classify at least 20-30 unique records or more (more is
						better)
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>

			<para>Once you've classified records you can press the 'Train model'
				button in the upper right corner. This will refine the matching
				model and present a new set of interesting potential duplicates. You
				can continue this way and quite quickly have classified the required
				amount of pairs.
			</para>

			<para>
				All duplicate detection models may have irregularities. When
				you ask a computer to do a complex task like matching, it may come
				up with a model that has slight differences from your
				classifications. You can inspect the current model's differences
				from your classifications in the tab 'Differences'.
			</para>

			<para>
				Every time you classify a duplicate, it is added to the
				<emphasis>reference</emphasis>
				of the Training session. You can inspect your complete
				reference in
				the tab 'Reference'.
			</para>

			<para>If you're looking for particular types of duplicate pairs, you
				may want to go to the 'Search' tab. In this tab you will find
				options to search for records with matching or non-matching values
				for particular fields. This may be a very useful shortcut for
				finding proper duplicate examples.
			</para>

			<para>Finally, the tab 'Parameters' presents buttons and sliders for
				you to influence the Machine Learning approach. It presents the
				following options:

								as duplicates and uniques. This is the default value.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>Always optimize the preselection</entry>
							<entry>This will always train pre-selection and matching rules.
								Training both is slower, but an improved preselection has a
								better performance during
								duplicate detection. Training the
								potential pair generation too early
								might result in the exclusion
								of some groups of duplicate pairs.
								It is recommended to perform
								training of the full model only after the user has
								classified
								varying examples of duplicates and unique records.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>

						</row>
					</tbody>
				</tgroup>
			</table>

			<para>
				After updating the matching model, the user can continue in 2
				ways. If
				the user is satisfied with the model (few false positives
				and false
				negatives) then he can save the model and start using it in
				duplicate detection. Otherwise, the user must start a new iteration
				of classifying
				more of the presented samples and refining the model
				again.
			</para>
			<para>
				Longer training set typically allows for a more advanced
				matching model,
				capable of handling more corner cases. The false
				negatives and
				false positives lists give a good impression of the
				current state of the
				matching model. The user should continue
				training until the
				differences
				in these lists are acceptable.
			</para>
			<para>
				When finishing the training, save the reference to file. The
				reference
				is the most important part of the Duplicate detection
				model, since it allows you to reproduce and re-train a model based
				on past classifications.

		<title>Boolean analyzer</title>
		<para>Boolean analyzer is an analyzer targeted at boolean values. For
			a single boolean column it is quite simple: It will show the
			distribution of true/false (and optionally null) values in a column.
			For several columns it will also show the value combinations and the
			frequencies of the combinations. The combination matrix makes the
			Boolean analyzer a handy analyzer for use with combinations of
			matching transformers and other transformers that yield boolean

						<entry>Property</entry>
						<entry>Description</entry>
					</row>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<row>
						<entry>Group column</entry>
						<entry>Allows you to define a pattern group column. With a pattern
							group column you can separate the identified patterns into
							separate buckets/groups. Imagine for example that you want to
							check if the phone numbers of your customers are consistent. If
							you have an international customer based, you should then group
							by a country column to make sure that phone patterns identified
							are not matched with phone patterns from different countries.
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Discriminate text case</entry>
						<entry>Defines whether or not to discriminate (ie. consider as
							different pattern parts) based on text case. If true
							"DataCleaner" and "datacleaner" will be considered instances of
							different patterns, if false they will be matched within same
							pattern.
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Discriminate negative numbers</entry>
						<entry>When parsing numbers, this property defines if negative
							numbers should be discriminated from positive numbers.
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Discriminate decimals</entry>
						<entry>When parsing numbers, this property defines if decimal
							numbers should be discriminated from integers.
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Enable mixed tokens</entry>
						<entry>
							<para>Defines whether or not to categorize tokens that contain
								both letters and digits as "mixed", or alternatively as two
								separate tokens. Mixed tokens are represented using questionmark
								('?')
								symbols.
							</para>
							<para>This is one of the more important configuration properties.
								For example if mixed tokens are enabled (default), all these
								values will
								be matched against the same pattern: foo123, 123foo,
								foobar123, foo123bar. If mixed tokens are NOT enabled only
								foo123 and foobar123 will be matched (because 123foo and
								foo123bar represent different combinations of letter and digit
								tokens).
							</para>
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Ignore repeated spaces</entry>
						<entry>Defines whether or not to discriminate based on amount of
							whitespaces.
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Upper case patterns expand in size</entry>
						<entry>Defines whether or not upper case tokens automatically
							"expand" in size. Expandability refers to whether or not the
							found patterns will include matches if a candidate has the same
							type of token, but with a different size. The default
							configuration for upper case characters is false (ie. ABC is
							not
							matched with ABCD).
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Lower case patterns expand in size</entry>
						<entry>
							<para>Defines whether or not lower case tokens automatically
								"expand" in size. As with upper case expandability, this
								property
								refers to whether or not the found patterns will include
								matches
								if a candidate has the same type of token, but with a
								different
								size. The default configuration for lower case
								characters is
								true
								(ie. 'abc' is not matched with 'abc').
							</para>
							<para>The defaults in the two "expandability" configuration
								properties mean that eg. name pattern recognition is meaningful:
								'James' and 'John' both pertain to the same pattern ('Aaaaa'),
								while 'McDonald' pertain to a different pattern ('AaAaaaaa').
							</para>
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Predefined token name</entry>
						<entry>Predefined tokens make it possible to define a token to
							look for and classify using either just a fixed list of values or
							regular expressions. Typically this is used if the values contain
							some additional parts which you want to manually define a
							matching category for. The 'Predefined token name' property
							defines the name of such a category.
						</entry>
					</row>
					<row>
						<entry>Predefined token regexes</entry>
